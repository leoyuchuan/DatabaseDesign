Project Phase II Document is our document for Phase II submission. (Docx & PDF are showing same content)

Our document contains everything for submission. However, for graph clearly issues, we also attach pdf files for each individual graph as following:
	Database Relational Schema Basic.pdf shows relational schema without foreign key (without line&pointers).
	Database Relational Schema Full.pdf shows relational schema with foreign key. (Relations, attributes, and primary keys are same with Basic PDF)
	Database Relational Schema Constrain.pdf shows constraints for each individual attributes. (Relations, attributes, and primary keys are same with Basic PDF)
	Updated EER.pdf shows modified EER model.
